    Hey, I'm Chris Liu! ðŸ‘‹
    <br />
    I'm a software engineer and content creator, who builds engaging websites
    like this one and makes YouTube videos about computer science & software
    engineering. After graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, I
    worked professionally as a software engineer building enterprise web
    applications for Fortune 500 companies. While doing all of that, I
    documented my coding journey on YouTube - trying to enlighten the next
    generation of developers and help them navigate the crazy world that is
    software engineering & computer science. Before I knew it, that online
    presence took on a life of its own, to the point where I knew I needed to
    make the jump from software engineering to full-time content creation -
    strike while the iron's hot. Now, I make videos about software engineering
    and computer science, building anything my heart desires, like this terminal
    website.
